## Project Product Description

Our music website, powered by Node.js and Express.js, delivers a seamless experience with cutting-edge technologies.
We utilized two new technologies in this project.
Firstly, we used svgator to generate the logo of our website
and secondly, using Howler.js, we created an immersive audio player which enhanced the music discovery process of the user(s).
Our RESTful API, built with Node.js and Express.js, ensures efficient data retrieval and seamless addition of new content through GET and POST routes.
We leverage the power of Handlebars.js as our template engine, providing a dynamic and visually stunning UI.
Our database, powered by MySQL and the Sequelize ORM, ensures reliable and scalable storage for music preferences.
We incorporated authentication using express-session and cookies, guaranteeing privacy and prioritizing data protection by safeguarding API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
We adhered to the MVC paradigm for a well-structured folder hierarchy. Moreover, we followed best practices to maintain a clean code, and provide comprehensive comments for readability and maintainability.
With our deployment on Heroku, access to our music website is available anytime, anywhere, while enjoying a responsive and polished UI that adapts seamlessly to your device.
